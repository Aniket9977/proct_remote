# Remote Proctoring App
This project is a real-time remote proctoring application that uses a webcam to detect facial landmarks and monitor suspicious activities, such as eye and mouth movements. The application leverages dlib and OpenCV for face detection and analysis.

Features

Detects and tracks 68 facial landmarks.
Monitors eye aspect ratio (EAR) to detect suspicious eye activities.
Monitors mouth aspect ratio (MAR) to detect suspicious mouth activities.
Displays the number of people detected in the camera frame
